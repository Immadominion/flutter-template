### Step 5: Deploy to Firebase Hosting

Deploy your Flutter web app to Firebase Hosting:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

After deployment, youâ€™ll receive a deployment URL:

```bash
https://<project-id>.web.app
```

## Mobile Deployment

### Android Deployment Using Google Play Store

#### Step 1: Prepare Your App for Release

1. Update the `android/app/build.gradle` file with your app's version information.
2. Create a keystore file and update the `key.properties` file with your keystore information.

#### Step 2: Build the APK

Build the release APK:

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

#### Step 3: Upload to Google Play Console

1. Sign in to your [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console).
2. Create a new application and fill in the required details.
3. Upload the APK file located at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`.

### iOS Deployment Using Apple App Store

#### Step 1: Prepare Your App for Release

1. Update the `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` file with your app's version information.
2. Ensure you have a valid Apple Developer account and certificates.

#### Step 2: Build the iOS App

Build the release IPA:

```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

Open the project in Xcode:

```bash
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
```

Archive the app and upload it to the App Store using Xcode.

#### Step 3: Upload to App Store Connect

## Configure Environment Variables

If your app uses environment variables, configure them in your build process:

### For Web

1. Go to the Firebase Console.
2. Select your project.
3. Go to Hosting > Environment Variables.
4. Add variables for your web app.

### For Mobile

1. Use a `.env` file and the `flutter_dotenv` package to manage environment variables.
2. Ensure sensitive information is not included in your version control.

## Update Deployment

Whenever you make changes to your code, update the deployment:

### For Web
